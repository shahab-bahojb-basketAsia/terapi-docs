## API gotchas

- OpenAI uses API_KEY auth mode with `Authorization: Bearer API_KEY` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- terapi supports automatic retries based on the `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` header from OpenAI's API. This header indicates when the request limit will reset, allowing terapi to efficiently manage API calls. Unlike `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`, which pertains to the total token usage,`x-ratelimit-reset-requests` specifically addresses the number of API requests.
- For users associated with multiple organizations or accessing their projects via a legacy user API key, optional headers can be included to specify the organization and project for the API request. Organization IDs can be found on your [Organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/organization) page, while project IDs can be found on your [General settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings) page.
- This can be done at the script level:
```js
const config:ProxyConfiguration = {
    endpoint: '/v1/models',
    headers: {
        'OpenAI-Organization': $organizationId,
        'OpenAI-Project': $projectId
    }
};
```
