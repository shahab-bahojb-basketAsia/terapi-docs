## API gotchas
- E-conomic in this setup uses `Basic` auth mode for different API endpoints. Provide `YOUR_PRIVATE_TOKEN` as the Username and `YOUR_AGREEMENT_GRANT_TOKEN` as the Password.
- After establishing a connection, use the Basic credentials as follows:
```js
const connection = await terapi.getConnection();
let headers:  = ;
if ('username' in connection.credentials && 'password' in connection.credentials) ;
} else );
}

const resp = await terapi.get();
```
