API configuration: [`zendesk`](https://terapi.dev/providers.yaml)


Zendesk has two kinds of OAuth apps:
- Helpdesk/support apps
- CRM apps

Terapi currently only supports OAuth for the Helpdesk apps. If you need CRM, reach out or contribute it :)

## Connection configuration in Terapi

Zendesk requires a user specific subdomain to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Terapi in the `terapi.auth()` call:

```js
terapi.auth('zendesk', '', {params: {subdomain: ''}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/integrate/guides/authorize-an-api#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

-   Make sure to create a Zendesk OAuth app (`https://.zendesk.com/admin/apps-integrations/apis/zendesk-api/settings`), _not_ a Zendesk Sales CRM OAuth app. 
-   Zendesk oAuth apps [must be made "global"](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/marketplace/building-a-marketplace-app/set-up-a-global-oauth-client/) to connect to multiple ``s.
