## Getting started

Workable offers API keys ("API access token"), partner tokens, and OAuth for authentication. Terapi currently only supports API-key-based authentication.

## Connection configuration in Terapi

Workable requires a user specific subdomain for the API base URL.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Terapi in the `terapi.auth()` call:

```js
terapi.auth('workable', '', {params: {subdomain: ''}});
```

For more details see the [docs here](/integrate/guides/authorize-an-api#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- To authorize a Workable Connection in Terapi you need to pass both the API key and the company's workable subdomain:
```js
terapi.auth('workable', '', {
        credentials: {
            apiKey: ''
        },
        params: {
            subdomain: ''
        }});
```

- The API base URL in Terapi is set to `https://{subdomain}.workable.com` for future forward compatability. To call endpoints of the V3 API, prefix the endpoint with `/spi/v3/`, e.g. `/spi/v3/candidates`.
