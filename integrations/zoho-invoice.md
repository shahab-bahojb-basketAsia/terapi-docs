## Connection configuration in Terapi

Zoho uses [different domain extensions](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/multi-dc.html) for different regions. 

You need to pass the domain extension to use to Terapi in the `terapi.auth()` call:

```js
terapi.auth('zoho-invoice', '', {params: {extension: 'com'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/integrate/guides/authorize-an-api#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas
- You can make your OAuth app cross-data-centers with [these instructions](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/multi-dc.html). This means that a single OAuth app will be able to query the Zoho API for Zoho accounts from the US, EU, etc.
