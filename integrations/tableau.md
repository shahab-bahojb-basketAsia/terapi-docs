## API gotchas

- When creating a new Terapi connection, please supply your Token name as your PAT NAME, Token secret as your PAT SECRET, and the content URL, which is the value that appears after `/site/` in the browser address bar for Tableau Cloud, i.e `/site/terapi1ec257d4d0/user/`, would be `terapi1ec257d4d0`. This field is left blank if you are using Tableau Server.
- You will also need to provide the [version](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_concepts_versions.htm) and [server](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_concepts_auth.htm#the-sign-in-uri) name.
