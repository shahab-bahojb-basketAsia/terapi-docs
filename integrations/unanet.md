## API gotchas

- Unanet uses `Basic` auth mode to access different endpoints. Provide your `username` as the Username value and `password` as the Password value. Additionally, Unanet requires an API key and a firm access code when creating a new connection which are provided upon [signup](https://compass.cosential.com/home/start).
